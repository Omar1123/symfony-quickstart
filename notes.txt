Group:
OK  6) create "Groups" page with list of groups
OK  7) add "Create group" and "Edit group" (edit in ajax)
OK  8) add "Delete", and pagination/filtering
9) add "Manage users" page (list of group's users, list of available users, both pagined/filterable)

bug: looks like "change lang" doesn't keep filters/pages

create a simple Profile page
- nickname
- contact
(automatic freeze on change)
- delete account (configurable in parameters.yml)

Light:
12) Use of pdo_sqlite by default is more relevent on quick websites
